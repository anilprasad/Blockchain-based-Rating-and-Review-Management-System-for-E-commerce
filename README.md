A Blockchain-based Rating & Review Management System
----------------------------------------------------

This project was undertaken as a part of my degree in Computer Science.

__Goals__:
- Design and develop a blockchain-based system which can be used to store and manage the rating
and review records generated by an online shopping platform.

- Retrieve and visualize review data stored on the blockchain. For example, simple statistical
analysis, such as, ratings received in the last week, etc.
